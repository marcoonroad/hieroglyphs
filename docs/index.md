This library uses the Blake2B hash algorithm, but further / additional hashes are
planned as well. Currently, the following things are implemented now:

- [x] Importing/exporting encrypted private key (by now using AES CBC).
- [x] Public Key serialization+validation (to share and receive such key for verification).
- [x] Built-in one-time invariant protected by a blacklist of used private keys.
- [x] Tests covering the things here and there.
- [x] Benchmarks against currently famous Digital Signatures algorithms (RSA family,
  Elliptic Curves family, etc - ~~by now only RSA~~ see below).
- [x] API documentation for the project (I should prefer automatic generation of
  documentation tools and provide the API documentation online under GH pages).
- [ ] Stress tests and prediction/timing simulated attacks, to prove the underlying
  library security and Private Key collision-free/resistance semantics.

The novel approach of this library is to sign every piece of hexadecimal character
from a given hash, so our range to sign and verify bits/bytes is smaller (we only
need 16 characters offset plus digest / fingerprint length of the message hash,
in the case of Blake2B, 128 characters). By hashing beforehand our message, we
can sign any size/length of input message, our signature, private key and public
key stay on the same size.


### Installation:

If this library is available on OPAM:

```shell
$ opam install hieroglyphs
```

Otherwise, through Dune build system:

```shell
$ dune install
```

### Usage:

(Assuming you've linked this library as `hieroglyphs`...)

```ocaml
module Hg = Hieroglyphs

let (priv, pub) = Hg.pair ( ) in
let msg = "Hello, World!" in
match Hg.sign ~priv ~msg with
| None -> failwith "Private key was already signed!"
| Some signature -> assert (Hg.verify ~pub ~msg ~signature)
```

A blacklist of revoked Private Key unique & deterministic IDs is maintained at
the directory `$HOME/.hieroglyphs/state/blacklist`. It's used to preserve the
one-time signing invariant. You can inspect the additional bare Git repository
provided by the Irmin library at `$HOME/.hieroglyphs/state`. If you don't like
to pollute your home directory with configuration noise / garbage, you may
override that with the environment variable `$HIEROGLYPHS_ROOT`. For instance,
if you define:

```shell
HIEROGLYPHS_ROOT=/tmp/hg-data
export HIEROGLYPHS_ROOT
```

Then, your blacklist will be available under `/tmp/hg-data/state/blacklist`, and
your Git repository under `/tmp/hg-data/state`.

For the complete API reference, check the docs
[here](https://marcoonroad.github.io/hieroglyphs/apiref/). Coverage reports are
shown at this [page](https://marcoonroad.github.io/hieroglyphs/coverage/).


### Benchmarks:

Currently, we run benchmarks against the `nocrypto` RSA/PSS+SHA256
implementation, and the `secp256k1` library (using a SHA256 hash as well on the
message), besides our implementation in pure OCaml code using Blake2B (although
future plans include C bindings). The benchmark test suite is available under
the command `$ make bench`. It uses the quite good Jane Street's `core_bench`
library. The cached benchmark report is generated by `dune` build system at the
file `test/bench/bench.expected` whenever you type `$ make bench`.


### Disclaimer:

This library was not yet fully tested against many sort of attacks, such as timing
attacks, but nevertheless the real security lies behind the `digestif` and `nocrypto`
libraries, which both provide strong hashes, strong RNGs and strong encryption. Use
with care and take responsibility by your own acts.
